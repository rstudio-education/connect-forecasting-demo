## Dave's Forecast

Management has requested a sales forecast for the remainder of 2018 based on historical sales data. This document describes the techniques I used to generate the forecast and summarizes the forecast results.

### Historical Data Used

Management provided the following historical data for the forecast.
[![Excel Bar chart of sales data](MVD-monthly-sales-screenshot.jpg){width=75%}](http://MVD-monthly-sales-screenshot.jpg)

### Approach

I fit a Holt Winters model on the total sales from the spreadsheet. I chose the Holt Winters model because it incorporates level, trend, and seasonality components, all of which may be present in our sales data.

Once the model was fit, I created a forecast using that model for the next 9 months and used `ggplot` to show the results graphically. The results of the analysis have been published to our RStudio Connect server where others within the company can view them.

### Results

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

## We do all the computations up front so that we can present the results in report form.

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(tibbletime)
library(forecast)
library(tidyquant)
library(timetk)
library(sweep)
widget_sales <- read_csv("/tmp/mvd-data/widget_sales_monthly.csv") # Read in the data
widget_sales_gathered <- widget_sales %>% 
  select(date, total_sales) %>% 
  gather(product, sales, -date) %>%
  arrange(date) # Gather all the product info into a single column arranged 

## Create time series from the data and forecast it
widget_sales_ts <- widget_sales_gathered %>% 
  mutate(sales_ts = ts(sales, start=2016, freq=12))

## Now model and forecast out
widget_sales_model <- HoltWinters(widget_sales_ts$sales_ts)
widget_sales_forecast <- forecast(widget_sales_model, h=9)

## Now gather all the data for each product into its own row, with the sales becoming
## a sub-tibble called 'data.tbl'
monthly_widget_sales_nested <-widget_sales_gathered %>%
  group_by(product) %>%
  nest(.key = "data.tbl")

## We need a time series for forecasting, so make one for each product

monthly_widget_sales_ts <- monthly_widget_sales_nested %>%
  mutate(data.ts = map(.x = data.tbl,
                       .f = tk_ts,        # this function creates the time series
                       start= 2016,
                       freq = 12))

monthly_sales_models <- monthly_widget_sales_ts %>%
  mutate(fit.model = map(data.ts, HoltWinters))     # apply HoltWinters model and put output in data.ts

monthly_sales_forecasts <- monthly_sales_models %>%
  mutate(fcast = map(fit.model, forecast, h=9)) # apply forecast for 6 months

## Final steps: unnest the forecasts for each product into tidy form and then plot results
monthly_sales_forecasts_tidy <- monthly_sales_forecasts %>%
  mutate(sweep = map(fcast, sw_sweep, fitted = FALSE, timetk_idx = TRUE)) %>%
  unnest(sweep)

```

If we combine the historical data with the forecast, we can show the results graphically as follows. The forecast values appear in red.

```{r monthly data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
monthly_sales_forecasts_tidy %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = index, y = sales, color = key, group = product)) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lo.95, ymax = hi.95), 
                fill = "#D5DBFF", color = NA, size = 0) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lo.80, ymax = hi.80, fill = key), 
                fill = "#596DD5", color = NA, size = 0, alpha = 0.8) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(title = "Holt Winters Model Forecast",
         subtitle = "Total Sales of Widgets",
         x = "", y = "Thousands") +
    scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year", date_labels = "%Y") +
    scale_color_tq() +
    scale_fill_tq() +
    facet_wrap(~ product, scales = "free_y", ncol = 2) +
    theme_tq() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Our forecast yields the following numerical results through Q1 of 2019.

```{r results="asis", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::kable(as.data.frame(monthly_sales_forecasts$fcast) %>% select(Point.Forecast), 
             caption = "Widget Sales Forecast",
             digits=0, format.args=list(big.mark = ','), format = "html", table.attr = "style='width:30%;'")
```


### Conclusions
Based on the historical data provided, we expect declining sales through the end of the year, with a possible recovery in the first quarter of 2019. We might want to extend the forecast out further to examine whether that's just a seasonal rise or something more substantive.
